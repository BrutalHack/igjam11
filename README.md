# Game Description

Let’s see what can happen if someone gets your username and password.
Or much better: let’s simulate it.

You are guided through the story with notifications and can interact with elements by clicking.
Press Alt + F4 to exit the game.

Note: This one was quite ambitious and had to get cut down to finish in time. So expect buggy behavior, sorry!
